I like the idea of interacting directly with something that can potentially grow forever. My interest in collections began with writing stories and keeping a journal as a child. I fell in love with the idea of completely filling every page in the whole journal and then saving it as an heirloom to create more journals to add to my journal collection and so on.

This was not part of our plans, but since it was our last night in Ottawa, we quickly parked the car and hurried down the street to catch the show without hesitation.

One night after we both said things that really hurt each other, I said, why don't we go a trip like right now? I will book a hotel by the Ocean, drive down Highway One, and tomorrow morning, we will be walking on the beach.

I never thought she would agree. It was 9pm already. From San Jose to somewhere on Highway One is probably going to be hours of drive. But she just started packing.

The next morning, we walked on this sand beach, and found this cave.

Qualities valued: authenticity and vulnerability. Recognize them by being blunt with their thoughts and comfortable being themselves, even if people think they are weird or quirky; others' opinions don’t affect who they are. Found a few cherished friends from school, events, and internships. Impactful connections can be made anywhere if we genuinely like a person’s personality and character traits. Most appealing trait: quirkiness. Example: a friend making blunt jokes without realizing how rude or controversial it sounded, but it’s just their sense of humor and pure goofiness, which makes me smile. Sometimes I don’t laugh at his jokes because they are unexpectedly stupid, but I smile because it’s unexpected and the way his mind works. Memorable moments: doing funny shenanigans like sending off an introvert friend to her office with a Nazi salutation.

Outside of my project, I have a garden with around 180 plants, mostly cacti and succulents. One memorable cactus, my San Pedro, even saved my life back in ‘Nam. My love for plants began with my mama, who helped me grow a bonsai tree. Although I no longer have that bonsai, all my plants hold sentimental value.

Not sure if my humor is unique, but I watch lots of standup comedies and find the industry interesting too. My favorite comedians are Dave Chapelle and Kevin Hart, as I think people with good humor are pretty smart because comedy is not as easy as it appears. They have stories and take things lightheartedly even during hard times. I've been wanting to try stand-up but I'm a little scared haha, hopefully one day! Maybe I'd start with complaints about my first job or interesting things I encounter in life. The workplace is a bit toxic, with super tight deadlines for deals, leading to overtime on weekdays, weekends, and even holiday weekends. There's also no diversity, and most people are white males, making it hard to find common ground. I try to think neutrally and not react too negatively, but it's hard. I'm job hunting to change the situation, hoping to find an intersection between investment/finance and media. I want a combination of creative and quantitative work, although I've heard media or advertising companies can be laborious with not high salaries.
